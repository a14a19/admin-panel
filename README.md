# Admin Panel | React App

Edyoda learning project of React. This project is making one API call and then storing the data in localstorage for further usage. Also, form validation for login user and updating user/product details. 

Key features:
1. Chart.js is used for representation of data
2. Single item delete and multiple items delete functionality
3. Adding new items to the list
4. Updating user profile and making change persistant (Image updating functionality added as well)
5. User login validation, I could've impletement both, i.e, the user name must be an email and password must be 6 character long, a lower, an upper a special character and number must be used. But I've given user an option, that either the user name should be email or password needs to be as described.
